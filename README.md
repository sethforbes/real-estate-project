# Property Investment Calculator
Brief overview: In my Spring 2022 CS521 course, I created my own project where I constructed a basic, user-friendly calculator for determining whether a piece of property was worth investing in or not.

A bit about the course: This course covers the concepts of the object-oriented approach to software design and development using Python. It includes a detailed discussion of programming concepts starting with the fundamentals of data types, control structures methods, classes, arrays and strings, and proceeding to advanced topics such as inheritance and polymorphism, creating user interfaces, exceptions and streams. Upon completion fo these course students will be able to apply software engineering principles to design and implement Python applications that can be used within analytics and big data.

The course's requirements were functionally open-ended, but needed to include all of the various concepts we covered in class.
